What is Android?
Android is a stack of software for mobile devices which includes an Operating System, middleware 
and some key applications. The application executes within its own process and its own instance of 
Dalvik Virtual Machine. Many Virtual Machines run efficiently by a DVM device. DVM executes Java languages byte code 
which later transforms into .dex format files.

What is an Activity?
A single screen in an application, with supporting Java code.

What is an Intent?
A class (Intent) which describes what a caller desires to do. The caller will send this intent to Android’s 
intent resolver, which finds the most suitable activity for the intent. E.g. opening a PDF document is an intent, 
and the Adobe Reader apps will be the perfect activity for that intent (class).

What is a Sticky Intent?
sendStickyBroadcast() performs a sendBroadcast(Intent) known as sticky,
 i.e. the Intent you are sending stays around after the broadcast is complete, 
 so that others can quickly retrieve that data through the return value of registerReceiver(BroadcastReceiver, 
 IntentFilter). In all other ways, this behaves the same as sendBroadcast(Intent). One example of a sticky 
 broadcast sent via the operating system is ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED. When you call registerReceiver() for that action —
 even with a null BroadcastReceiver — you get the Intent that was last broadcast for that action. Hence, 
 you can use this to find the state of the battery without necessarily registering for all future state changes in the battery.

How the nine-patch Image different from a regular bitmap? Alternatively, what is the difference between 
nine-patch Image vs regular Bitmap Image?
It is one of a resizable bitmap resource which is being used as backgrounds or other images on the device.
The NinePatch class allows drawing a bitmap in nine sections. The four corners are unscaled; 
the middle of the image is scaled in both axes, the four edges are scaled into one axis.

What is a resource?
A user defined JSON, XML, bitmap, or other file, injected into the application build process, which can later be loaded from code.
How will you record a phone call in Android? or How to handle an Audio Stream for a call in Android?
Permission.PROCESS_OUTGOING_CALLS: Will Allow an application to monitor, modify, or abort outgoing calls. So using that permission we can monitor the Phone calls.

Does Android support the Bluetooth serial port profile?
Yes.

Can an application be started on powerup?
Yes. 

What is the APK format?
The APK file is compressed AndroidManifest.xml file with extension .apk. It also includes the application code (.dex files), resource files, and other files which are compressed into a single .apk file.
How to Translate in Android?
The Google translator translates the data of one language into another language by using XMPP to transmit data. You can type the message in English and select the language which is understood by the citizens of the country in order to reach the message to the citizens.
Describe Briefly the Android Application Architecture
Android Application Architecture has the following components:
Services like Network Operation
Intent – To perform inter-communication between activities or services
Resource Externalization – such as strings and graphics
Notification signaling users – light, sound, icon, notification, dialog etc.
Content Providers – They share data between applications
What is needed to make a multiple choice list with a custom view for each row?
Multiple choice list can be viewed by making the CheckBox android:id value be “@android:id /text1″. That is the ID used by Android for the CheckedTextView in simple_list_item_multiple_choice.
What dialog boxes are supported in android?Android supports 4 dialog boxes:
AlertDialog: An alert dialog box supports 0 to 3 buttons and a list of selectable elements, including check boxes and radio buttons. Among the other dialog boxes, the most suggested dialog box is the alert dialog box.

DatePickerDialog: This dialog box is used for selecting a date by the user.
TimePickerDialog: This dialog box is used for selecting time by the user.
